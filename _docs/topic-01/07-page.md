**Text documents** include many file types and can be simply described as any file that stores an [ASCII character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (as opposed to binary data), which is the most common format for the English language. These text files can include text documents of prose, code, or some combination of both.

## What types of files are text documents?
The simplest and most common text document is a "text file", which will bare the `.txt` extension. This generic document type contains only ASCII characters. These are the common characters you use for writing and reading (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), and special characters (such as #, %, !, ., etc.). These files also include carriage returns (new line), tabs, spaces, and an end-of-file (eof) designation that let's a program know where the file finishes. This last group, of course, contains characters that are there but that are not displayed in basic text editors.
