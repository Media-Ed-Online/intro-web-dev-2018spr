## What U. R. L(ooking for):

You want to mail a package to an old friend, but you don't know where to send it. When you ask for their address, you get a country, state, city, steet, and house number.

We find sites on the web in pretty much the same way, but instead of looking for houses, we're looking for other computers, servers, files, or even queries on a network. A "web addresses" or **uniform resouce locator** (URL) is assigned to every website so that users and servers can find that site quickly and easily.

Directions for a site can be broken down similarly (in the most basic sense) to directions to a house, but more applicably into _protocol, domain, path_ and _file_.
