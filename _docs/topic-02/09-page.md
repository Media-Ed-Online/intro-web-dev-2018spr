One great thing about working with text files is that their simplicity makes it easy to track changes between various versions of a file. Since the files contain only [ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com) characters, it is easy to create programs that can look for character or word level changes to a document.

### Why use a VCS (Version Control System)?

- Version control allows a developer/writer to make changes to a file and track their changes over time. By ‘committing’ changes to a file with a simple, associated message, the developer can create a list of how they have changed the file over time.
- Version control also allows for a developer/writer to make changes that may or may not work. If they find that the change they made was inappropriate, or did not work, they can simply go back to a previous version. There is no need for directories full of “save as” files.
- Version control makes collaboration and sharing easier. Then all associated parties can see all changes made by each other, and manage any conflicts that may occur within a file.
