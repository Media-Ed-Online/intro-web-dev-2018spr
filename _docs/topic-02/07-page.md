We organize these different files into groups, just like you do with your other non-web-based files. We commonly refer to the containers of these files as "folders," because that's exactly as they function; folios containing related files. In addition, most operating systems represent these folders with graphic icons (folders), so it's reasonable that we call them that.

But once we branch away from our desktop however, this term is a little less applicable. Consider this URL:

<div style="padding: 40px 0px 80px 0px;">
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://www.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/usa/logo/m_logo.png" alt="McDonald's Logo" style="border: none;"/>
  </p>
  <p align="center">https://www.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/usa/logo/m_logo.png</p>
</div>

The path for this image, `/content/dam/usa/logo` actually refers to the nesting of its folders, or **directories**.

<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> "Folders" and "directories" refer to the same concept, but "directory" should be used when discussing file systems. You will hear us use directory most often.


### File and Folder Structure

Please watch the video below, which does a very good job of describing proper file structure for creating websites.

<span class="label label-danger">IMPORTANT:</span> **Pay special attention to file-naming conventions.** _Naming your files certain ways can cause your site to break._
