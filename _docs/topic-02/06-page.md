Maintaining organized files and consistent folder structure is key to creating effective workflow. This is especially important in web development because a URL contains **paths** which effectively provide directions to your files. Improperly cataloguing or even naming these files can lead to complete failure in loading your site.

### Types and Teamwork

Web designers use all types of files to create sites, from `.html` to `.css` to `.php` and dozens of others. How files are created and saved will affect how they are processed; a `.css` file will not have the same capabilities of a `.html` file, and vice versa. Most file types and their languages are designed to work _together,_ not singularly, and need to be directed to each other.
