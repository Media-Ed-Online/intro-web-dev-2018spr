Since GitHub Desktop is nearly identical between Mac and PC, I will only be including one set of instructions for this section. If you get confused, please email your instructor.

<span class="label label-danger">IMPORTANT:</span> Take your time, and please follow these directions closely.

## Create a New Repository:

Repositories (or **repo** for short) are the bookbags of your sites, and contain all of the files, folders, and related content. A `readme.md` file is placed at the highest level of the working directory (the "main" folder) to provide information about that repo.
