As stated, the majority of your learning materials will be posted of this site. The course is broken up into 4 Projects modules, with 3-4 learning Topics each (as seen in the "Modules" dropdown menu above).

The left navigation menu further breaks up this topics into digestable portions, numbered 01 and up.

The last page of each sub-topic is listed under a <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **TODO** heading. This page will provide you with outside materials, review opportunities, or links to assignment requirements. Effectively, it should help you gauge what you should have taken away from the sub-topic.
