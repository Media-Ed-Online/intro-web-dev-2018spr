On the last page, we learned how to place elements "wherever" we want. We even learned how to place elements over other elements, thereby, blocking those elements.

The z-index property allows developers to specify which elements should be placed on top of other elements. The z-index property takes an integer number as its value (i.e. -1000 to 1000). Those elements with higher z-index values will be drawn on top elements with lower values.
