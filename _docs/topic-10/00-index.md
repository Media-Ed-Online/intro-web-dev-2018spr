## 10: The Box Model

This is a significant Topic, as we will start to look at how we can use CSS to adjust the layout of elements within our websites.

Specifically, we will be looking at element boxes, block elements, and their positioning on the page. This involves setting height and width amounts (including minimum and maxium values), margins, padding, borders, and visibility.

Knowing these properties in the first step in creating site layouts, and will help you as you get into more advanced design principles.

By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
- Have a better understanding about block levels.
- Can place elements on the page _where_ you want them to live.
- Begin to think about layout when approaching creating content for webpages.
