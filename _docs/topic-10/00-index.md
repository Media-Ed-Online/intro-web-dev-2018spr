## 10: The Box Model

This is a significant week, as we will start to look at how we can use CSS to adjust the layout of elements within our websites.

Specifically this week, we will be looking at:

- Element Boxes
    - Height & Width, and setting min and max values
    - Margin
    - Padding
    - Box Borders
    - Hiding Elements
- Inline Block Elements
- Element Position
- Introduction To Layouts
    - Fixed
    - Liquid

By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
- Have a better understanding about block levels.
- Can place elements on the page _where_ you want them to live.
- Begin to think about layout when approaching creating content for webpages.
