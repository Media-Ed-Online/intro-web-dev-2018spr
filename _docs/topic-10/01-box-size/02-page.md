The advantage of 'hard-coding' the size of elements to absolute values using pixels, is that you know exactly how the site will look. The relationships of elements to each other will stay the same, and never change. Of course, this may lose impact if the screen size of the viewer's device is not large enough to see all of the content, and they are forced to awkwardly scroll around.

This may also get slightly askew when your user increases or decreases the font size of page which will cause the boxes to increase/decrease as well.

That being said, there are times when using pixels is appropriate.
