The `<audio>` element allows developers to add an audio player to webpages. This is a new element to HTML5, and offers three supported audio formats: .mp3, .wav, and .ogg.

The **audio element** can be used to add a self-hosted audio file to your site, and allows for both single-instances and fallback files to be referenced in the element.
