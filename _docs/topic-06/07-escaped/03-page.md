There are two ways of including an escape character in your HTML text. The first, mentioned above, simply utilizes the decimal based character code. This of course can be difficult to remember for the characters you may need.

Characters used often have special codes that are more "human readable", known as "entity names". For example, the less than and greater than characters (`<` & `>`) have entity names 'lt' and 'gt', respectively. To use an entity name, prepend it with the ampersand and appended with a semicolon. So to use `<` & `>` as actual characters in HTML write `&lt;` and `&gt;`.
