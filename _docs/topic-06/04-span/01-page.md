The `<span>` element is the inline equivalent of the `<div>` element. It serves to identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling.

One specific use for the `<span>` element is to identify text that needs to appear visually unique on the rendered HTML page.

As with the `<div>` element, the `<span>` element should include a class or ID attribute to provide;

- a reference to styling code,
- and/or information to developers about the inner content.
