[The Audio Archive](https://archive.org/details/audio) is a great source of royalty-free and creative commons audio works, usually offered in MP3 format.

A personal favorite for music is through [Incompetech.com](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/collections.php), which offers a ton of free-use (credit required) music and background audio.

Again, any audio you use should be your own or in "fair public use," usually under [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) (CC) public licence. **You should always credit the author when asked to do so.**

Test your pages on multiple computers and browsers to make sure the embedded media works.

##### Converting Files

You likely will not have access to the original file to export an .ogg file, whether it's a song you own or have recently sources. You may need to use an online converter like [Convertio](https://convertio.co/mp3-ogg/) or [Zamzar](http://www.zamzar.com/convert/mp3-to-ogg/) to provide a .ogg file. Again, this is only a band-aide; ideally, you're providing your own created audio (music, recordings, sound effects, etc) which you can export as an .ogg legally.
