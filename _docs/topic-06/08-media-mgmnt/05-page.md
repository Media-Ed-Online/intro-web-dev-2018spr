In the next two sections, we will be looking at the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements. You need to be careful when using these elements, as older browsers will not support these elements and the presentation of the associated media. To create pages viewable by all, you should use a variety of approaches to account for multiple ages of browsers. You _should_ also include flash options, as some older browsers will prefer this.

<span class="label label-danger">IMPORTANT:</span> Web hosting companies often charge extra if you use a lot of bandwidth, and due to the size of most movie files, this can occur easily when self-hosting. **Third-party options** provide you affordable solutions to this potential problem.

<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> You should technically use both flash and HTML5 video element when self-hosting. However, it is my opinion that flash is dead, so I have focused solely on HTML5.
