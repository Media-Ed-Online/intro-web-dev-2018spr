All media you use on your sites should be your own or in "fair public use," usually under [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) (CC) public licence. **You should always credit the author when asked to do so.**

Always test your pages on multiple computers and browsers to make sure the embedded media works.

#### Video

 A cellphone video is a good option, or [The Moving Image Archive](https://archive.org/details/movies) as creative-commons video that you can download, which conviently show metadata like size and filetype. Here's an example about [Pluto](https://archive.org/details/Pluto_Flyby):

<center><div style="width: 400px;">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/237977600?autoplay=0&loop=1&color=1CCDCA&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<img src="../imgs/archive-download-hover.png" alt="Hovering mouse over download icons" title="Downloading with Archive.org" width="400" height="auto" style="border: none;" />
<p style="font-size: small; color: #333; text-align: left; margin: 0">Notice how hovering your cursor over the download link shows you the file size? Most videos give you the two required options you need: H.264 (<code>.mp4</code>) and an open-source type (<code>.ogg</code>).</p>
