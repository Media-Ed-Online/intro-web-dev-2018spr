For the reasons above, it is sometimes preferable and encouraged for you to host your media on sites such as [YouTube](https://youtube.com), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com), [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), or [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/).

**The advantage of using a hosted media provider is that you can upload a high-quality version of your media and these sites will handle compatibility, encoding, and the other details necessary for the media to play on a variety of browsers.** Additionally, web hosting companies often charge extra if you use a lot of bandwidth, and due to the size of most movie files, this can occur easily when self-hosting. These third-party options provide you affordable solutions to this potential problem.
