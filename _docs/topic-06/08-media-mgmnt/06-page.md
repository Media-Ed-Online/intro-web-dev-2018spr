For the reasons above, it is sometimes preferable and encouraged for you to host your media on sites such as [YouTube](https://youtube.com), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com),  [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), or [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/).

<span class="label label-danger">IMPORTANT:</span> The advantage of using a hosted media provider is that you can upload a high-quality version of your media and these sites will handle compatibility, encoding, and the other details necessary for the media to play on a variety of browsers.
