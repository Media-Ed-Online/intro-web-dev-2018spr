The class attribute follows the same technical naming conventions as the ID attribute. As with the ID attribute, the class attribute value should be as descriptive as possible about the function or element types groups, while prioritizing both brevity and readability.

### More Than One Class

Unlike the ID attribute which should contain a single unique ID value, elements may have more than one class assignment. In this case, a space separates each class.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<div class="class-name-1 class-name-2 notice-the-space">
    Notice the space between each of the three class names.
</div>
```
