One metadata use that you should be familiar with is the **charset** declaration. This informs the browser of the character set encoding of the document (i.e. the character set that matches the binary data).

You should always include the metadata charset line in your head element of your html documents.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
