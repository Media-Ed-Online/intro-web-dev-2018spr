You can assign any value you want to the `name` attribute of the meta element. This can be used for other developers, web browser parsers you design, or to store information you deem necessary.

As one example, Twitter instructs developers to use specific, unique-to-Twitter name values in the meta element when building Twitter applications. You can check that out on the [Twitter developer pages](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started).

There are however, some specific `name` values that you need to be aware of and use in your pages. These standard meta types are parsed and read by browsers and search engines.
