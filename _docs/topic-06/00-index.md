## 06: Managing Media

This is the last Topic where we will look at HTML elements in depth. At the point you should be comfortable with:

- The Basics of HTML, Including:
    - Elements
    - Tags
        - Attributes
        - Opening and Closing Tags
        - Empty Tags
- The Basic Structure of an HTML Document:
    - The HTML Element
    - The Head and Body Elements
- Structural vs. Semantic Elements
- Nesting Elements
- Linking to Other Files (i.e. Images)
- User Input

This week we will be wrapping up our unit on HTML by looking at three groups: additional structural elements, media, and metadata.


By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
- Have experimented with using `<div>`s to structure the contents of your pages.
- Understand how media is placed and accessed on the internet (hosted vs. streaming).
- Source and reference outside materials directly within your site pages.
