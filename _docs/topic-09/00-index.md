## 09: Typography

Moving on with CSS, this week will cover text and fonts. Despite being a very graphic art, the success of a good web design is usually heavily dependent on how it treats its use of written elements. To study this, we will look at:

- Typography
- Choosing Fonts
- Normal, Hover, and Active States

Grasping these concepts will make your text visually interesting without sacrificing structure and legibility.

By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
- Know how to source fonts from the web.
- Understand the difference and usage of system, web, and web-safe fonts.
- Have considered appropriate text styling, balancing “fun” and “functionality” in your site design.
