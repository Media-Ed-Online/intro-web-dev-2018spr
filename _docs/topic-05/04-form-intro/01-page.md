Forms and form elements are used by web developers to collect data & information from users on websites. This can include:

- drop down boxes (multiple choices)
- text entry (usernames, real names, phone numbers, e-mails, etc)
- radio checkmarks/buttons (select all-that-apply)
- password input (hidden text)
- buttons (used for submitting information and navigating to new pages)
- file uploads

We will not use forms very much this semester, as they inherently require a more robust language to handle their collection and transmission. This is one of the roles of **JavaScript**, which will be discussed more in the second Web course ("Web Technologies"). However, there are services which will allow us to create forms for websites that can do the front-end and back-end lifting/handling of the data.

The most common example of a form in use is a searchbox, such as [Google](https://google.com) or [Bing](https://bing.com).
