There are a lot of details about images you need to learn.

These focus around the specifics of using images and some general rules of thumb you should keep in mind:

1. Save the image in the right format.
2. Save images at the right size (width and height, resolution).
3. Measure image `width=""` and `height=""` in pixels.
