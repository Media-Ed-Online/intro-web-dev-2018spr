It is possible to use HTML5 to inform users if they have entered information correctly. This is known as “**form validation**”.

Traditionally, form validation occurred with JavaScript, but HTML5 has added this feature.

Validation helps ensure the user enters information correctly and with the correct "types" of data. Validation before submitting a form to a server reduces server load and enables users to more quickly see if there are errors in their form.

An example of form validation is the `required` attribute. Try pressing the 'Submit' button before entering any text:


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="300" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="rGYxWv" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Intro-Web-Dev] Topic-05: New HTML5 Elements, Pt. 1" class="codepen"></p>
</div>


<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> This is not yet supported on all browsers (i.e. Safari), so it may be necessary to also include other types of form validation (Such as with JavaScript).
