## 05: Figures and Forms

It's time to get into the juicier HTML elements. This Topic, you'll be introduced to some multi-part elements, including images, tables, and one of the foundations of web development - forms.

When thinking about the sites you often visit, images are probably the first memorable element that comes to mind. As designers, we need to consider how and when to add images, what filetypes to use, their sizes, and what code element works best for each specific situation.

Although they appear antiquated by today's visual standards, HTML tables are still used quite often to present data in structured formats. One way to collect data from visitors is through forms, or question-response collections where users enter data that is then sent to a server for processing. A common form you encounter daily is the _user login_.


By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
- Have manipulated images to work best for the web.
- Understand how elements can be stringed together to better describe, present, and gather information.
- Played around with form elements, and explored how data is presented and collected on websites.
