We will begin working in-depth with HTML in the next Topic. For now, I want you to just have basic understanding of how HTML renders.

HTML is a language that describes the structure of a document intended for viewing through a browser. The browserâ€™s processor identifies _elements_ of the document by looking for _tags_ embedded directly in the text. These elements are then parsed into the _Document Object Model (DOM)_.

We can compare the basic structure of HTML to Markdown in the hierarchy of its elements. However, HTML is much more robust, and therefore needs more information to compile correctly.
