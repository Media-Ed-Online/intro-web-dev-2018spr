Almost every website you encounter has a master file called the **index.** There can be multiple index files on a site, but at least one `index.html` is homepage of the site.

You are going to create a lot of files labeled `index.html`. When a URL is passed to a browser that does not specify a file, the browser automatically requests `index.html` from the host server.

Essentially, this means something like `http://baseurl.com` and `http://baseurl.com/index.html` are the _same_. (This is not true for all websites, but for many.)
