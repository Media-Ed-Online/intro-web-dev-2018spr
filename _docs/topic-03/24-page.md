Now that you know that most elements are made up of an opening-closing pair of tags, it's worth noting that there are common instances known as **empty elements**. An â€˜empty element' only has one tag. Before the closing bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. It is a good habit to get into writing these tags in this way.

You've already seen an _empty element_ during this Topic, with line breaks, `<br />`.
