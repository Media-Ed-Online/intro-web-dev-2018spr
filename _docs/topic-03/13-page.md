## `<body>...</body>`

The _body_ element is a container for all of the content and data that is intended to be displayed on a browserâ€™s page.

If you want your visitors to see or have access to an element, it will nearly always be inside the _body_. In our analogy, we can say that the _body_ is the physical "body" of the site that visitors meet, see, and interact with.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Way-Cool Awesome Site</title>
    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- My "Way-Cool Awesome Site" contents, visible to visitors. -->
  </body>
</html>
```
