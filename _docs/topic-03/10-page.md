Everything is HTML is described through elements. This includes the larger structure of the main document.

<img src="../img/person-doc-think.png" alt="person thinking to themselves" title="Hmm..." style="width: 100px; float: right; margin: 0 0 5px 5px" />

In this sub-topic, we'll build the basic structure of a _single_ page, going step-by-step through the standard page elements. It is worthwile to note that, usually, there is **only one set** of each of these elements per page, beginning with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration. We can even compare these elements to your _own_ very structure.

## `<!DOCTYPE>`

The document type element is the first element in an HTML document, and should be placed on the first line in a document. This element tells the browser's processor what type of HTML document it is.

The ``<!DOCTYPE>`` declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

```
