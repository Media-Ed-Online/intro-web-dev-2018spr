GitHub.com provides free web hosting for static websites (a static site is one that does not involve server-side computational work beyond serving or delivering files to a requesting host-computer). For this course, this means we can utilize them as a our server, and they will also provide us with URLs!

GitHub assigns each user the following URL:
_username.github.io_

This is your _baseurl_. You will "attach" paths to further child directories and files to the end of this basurl. For example, `https://JustineEvansUM.github.io/web-dev-hw/assignment-2/`
