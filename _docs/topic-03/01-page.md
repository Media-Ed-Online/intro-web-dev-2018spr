One of the new tools you will be using this week is a web browser.

A **web browser**, internet browser, or simply "browser," is a software program used to access the internet from a device. Web designers use web languages like _HTML_, _CSS_, and _JavaScript_ to write the instructions that browsers translate and render into the intended layouts of text, graphics, and other content.

Browsers have come a long way. Originally utilitarian and only able to render text, they can now handle multiple forms of media, tabbed browsing, and secure financial transfers.
