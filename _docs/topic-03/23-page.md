A horizontal rule is a line that runs across the browser window. These can be used to visually differentiate content in a document.

Please note that line breaks `<br />` and horizontal rules `<hr />` are known as **empty elements**. An â€˜empty element' only has one tag. Before the closing bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. It is a good habit to get into writing these tags in this way.
