## 08: Intro to CSS

So far this session, some of the things you have learned include:

- A brief history of the internet and how the web and browsers work.
- The difference between a text document and a binary document.
- How to work with the git version control system (VCS), as well as utilize a remote repository.
- 2 markup languages:
    - markdown (`.md`)
    - HTML (`.html`)
- The necessary elements to create a basic web page that can be served to a browser.

While we've explored styling briefly in the previous topics, it's time to really dig into learning how to use CSS or <span style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline; color: #E95420;">C</span>ascading <span style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline; color: #E95420;">S</span>tyle <span style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline; color: #E95420;">S</span>heets.

<span style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline; color: #E95420;">CSS</span> is a language that tells browsers how to display and style content in HTML. It will not change the content itself, but will allow you to specify color, font, size, background, padding, alignment, how pages resize, if certain elements should be hidden, and many more qualities.


By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
- Understand how CSS functions in web design, and the many ways we can use it in our pages.
- Have experimented with CSS selectors, and tried linking your _own_ stylesheet to your HTML pages.
