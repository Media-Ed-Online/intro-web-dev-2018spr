Not all properties will inherit their value from the parent element.

Text properties tend to inherit values from their parents; however, some properties do not. As with many things in web development, this is partly browser-specific.


### Forcing Inheritance

If you are worried, or find a property that is not inheriting, you can force inheritance with the `inherit` keyword as the properties value.
