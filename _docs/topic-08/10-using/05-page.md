In web development, it is important to select a set of colors that compliment each other, while positively presenting your content. There are many resources for choosing such sets. To get started, please read the following article creating color palettes for visually impactful web design.

- Use [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/app), [Paletton](http://paletton.com/), or [Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to help you create a color scheme.
- See what kind of schemes are "stylish," "lively," "subtle," or "striking," by exploring some of the sites listed on [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/website-color-schemes/) and [Canva](https://designschool.canva.com/blog/website-color-schemes/). Do any apply to the mood or style you want to create?
