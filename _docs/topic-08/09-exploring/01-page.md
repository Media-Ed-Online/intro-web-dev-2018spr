Now that you are familiar with the basics or CSS, including how to apply rules, cascading, and selectors, let's start using it. The first major topic in CSS will focus on color. Specifically, how to specify colors for text and backgrounds.

- Color Names
- RGB
- Hex Values

All work in a practically the same way, by specifying the amount of red, green, and blue that should be combined to make a color.

Each color has a possible range of 256 values, 0-255. Remember in a 0-based system, '0' counts as a value.
