Any site with a respectable amount of content needs to have reliable site navigation. In this site, for example, the main navigation is divided as such:
- A logo and site title that link back to the home.
- Links to site pages, including a dropdown menu to modules.
- Icons to outside resources.

This navigation is available at all times while browsing the site. The _section navigation_ to the left however, only populates pages relative to its module, and is unavailable otherwise.

For your Instructable, you should consider two types of page navigation:
1. Via a navigation element (set of page links).
2. Jumping to parts of long pages using `ids` and `href` elements.
