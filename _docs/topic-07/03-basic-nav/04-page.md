We've been discussing external and internal linking for several topics now, so this should be review. Utilizing the "dot method" to navigate from page-to-page may take practice, however. Links to review previous sections are provided in the next &nbsp;<i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **TODO**.

<span class="label label-danger">IMPORTANT:</span> You will have to add the `<nav>` element to **every page** of the site, and this means your relative links may need to change, as you jump in-and-out of child directories. _Always test your links!_

<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="600" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="yKJEQX" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Topic-07: Basic Navigation, Pt. 3" class="codepen"></p>
</div>

<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> It is considered good practice to include "back to top" options for the user, to avoid excessive scrolling and confusion. This can be done by using `#` as the [source's placeholder](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#dom-location-hash), or creating an id at the page's beginning.
