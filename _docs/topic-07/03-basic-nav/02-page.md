With HTML5 came the **nav element**. A `<nav>` block can contain your site's _major_ page or intra-page links, and can be used to declare a menu, table of contents, or site index.

Using the `<nav>` element is considered good practice because of its accessible features, but is also useful for styling purposes.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<body>
  <nav id="main-menu">
    <!-- Site Links -->
  </nav>

  <!-- Further page content -->
</body>
```

<span class="label label-danger">IMPORTANT:</span> As with anything you want visible to users, the `<nav>` element must be within the `<body>` of the page.
