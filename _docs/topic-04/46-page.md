A very common type of hyperlinking is to create an **e-mail link** within a page. This is accomplished by prepending “`mailto:`” to the desired e-mail address.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<a href="malto:example@site.com">E-mail</a>
```


So, to create a hyperlink that e-mails me:


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="gGWQZm" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Intro-Web-Dev] Topic-05: Links Pt. 4" class="codepen"></p>
</div>


Clicking on such a link in a webpage will cause the webpage to try and open the user's default e-mail application.

<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> For that reason, it is also good practice to write the full e-mail address out. That way a user can easily copy the address from the browser into the e-mail client of their choice.
