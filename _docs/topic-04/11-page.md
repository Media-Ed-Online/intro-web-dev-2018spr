In older versions of HTML and XHTML, the DOCTYPE included additional information on the page, as well as a reference link to the specification.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!-- The DOCTYPE for HTML 4.01 looks like this: -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">


<!-- Here’s the DOCTYPE for XHTML 1.0: -->
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
```

They’re not very human-readable, but, in their own way, they are simply saying “this document is written in HTML 4.01,” or “this document is written in XHTML 1.0.”
