The _title_ tag defines the title of a document. This action:

- defines a title in the browser toolbar.
- provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites.
- displays a title for the page in search-engine results.

You cannot have more than one title element. However, you _must_ have the title element for the document to validate as HTML. **This is the only required element in the head.**

_Remember?_ The _title_ tag aptly contains your site's or page's title.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="description" content="Head Elements in HTML">
    <meta name="author" content="Justine Evans">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Way-Cool Awesome Site</title>
  </head>

</html>
```
