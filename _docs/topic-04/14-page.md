There are a number of elements which we can consider as **required** in the head element, and others that you are _encouraged_ to include. These elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document, such as the title, author, and publication date.

_Remember?_ The _head_ element is a container for processing information and document metadata. The _head_ contains high-level information about the site, and always comes first within the root element. In this sense, we can consider the _head_ to contain the thoughts of the page.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
  </head>

</html>
```

The following pages provide you a proper order of placement of elements within the `<head>`; however, there is no strict documentation on this order.
