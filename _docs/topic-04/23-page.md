  <p>Semantic markup us used to reinforce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics" taget="_blank">semantics</a> - or meaning - of the information in a document. Semantic markup might be used to place <em>emphasis</em> on a word or phrase, or identify a word as being <strong>strong</strong>. They can also provide <cite>citations</cite> or <q>quotations</q>, link to <dfn>definitions</dfn>, or distinguish <del>editorial changes</del>.</p>
</div>

<p>For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px; font-size: medium">Known as <cite>Clue</cite> in North America, <cite>Cleudo</cite> is a murder-mystery game based on <b>strategy</b> and <b>deduction.</b> Players make arguments based on their questioning of the perpetrator, location, and method of the crime.</p>

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<p>Known as <cite>Clue</cite> in North America, <cite>Cleudo</cite> is a murder-mystery game based on <b>strategy</b> and <b>deduction.</b> Players make arguments based on their questioning of the perpetrator, location, and method of the crime.</p>
```
We can use this pattern in HTML using text, tags, and markup to create arguments for our content and its meaning.
