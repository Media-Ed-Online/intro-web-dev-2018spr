You might expect the DOCTYP> declaring “this document is written in HTML5” would have the number five in it somewhere. It doesn’t. The doctype for HTML5 looks like this:

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
The DOCTYPE declaration should be the **first** thing in your HTML file; on line 1.
