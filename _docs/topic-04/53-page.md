It may seem ridiculous or silly, but there's such a thing as being a respectful dev that writes clean, proper code.

What does this look like? Well, a site with well-written markup will have:

1. Logical or Liner Ordering
2. Properly Nested Tags
3. Indented Elements

There are many other unspoken rules you can Google, but those 3 are my major pet peeves when done poorly - _and I'm likely to call you out on them._
