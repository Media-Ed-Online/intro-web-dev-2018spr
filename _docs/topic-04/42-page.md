One of the primary reasons for the Internet was to be able to easily reference research when citing others, with an ability to directly “link” to their work.

In computing, a **hyperlink**, or simply a link, is a reference to data that the reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.

**Hypertext** is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked is called _anchor text_. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system, and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to link). A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext. [<sup>\[1]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Wikipedia - Hyperlink")
