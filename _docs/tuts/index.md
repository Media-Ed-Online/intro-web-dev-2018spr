We all have questions. And sometimes they're the same questions! Please use the FAQ to explore any possible solutions before contacting your instructurs. If the answer can't be found, please [send us an e-mail](../../../posts/contacts) or [post to the Issues board](https://github.com/Media-Ed-Online/intro-web-dev-resources/issues)!

If you need or are interested in step-by-step site design, feel free to follow along with our guided project tutorials to the right. Example files are provided, and you can follow-along with full instructions!
