## Course Overview

This course is intended to make you comfortable with presenting yourself through the web. In addition, you will learn skills that should allow you to build, manage, and develop websites.

We will start with an overview of technologies used for web development. This will be followed by an in-depth presentation of HTML and CSS, and will conclude by exploring responsive web design, site frameworks, and site management solutions.

This is exclusively an on-line course. As such, you will be expected to engage with all content through this main site. You will be assessed through regular project-based assignments, writings, and community engagement. The course will conclude with a final build (personal website) which will need to utilize all knowledge gained throughout the semester.

## Homework
All homework will be submitted on Moodle under specific assignment forums. You will submit links to your code sketch and technical report (both hosted via your GitHub repository) for every assignment.

Your homework will be assessed by the instructor and teaching assistants and recorded in Moodle. They will also provide you with individual feedback here, when necessary.

### Late Work
Homework can be accepted up to 7 days late, with a 50% reduction.

<p><span class="label label-danger">Note:</span> Workshop (peer review) deadlines are automatically switched-over by the system. Once they pass, you're locked out. Missing a submission deadline means you will not be able to participate, and will receive a 0 for that Workshop. We physically cannot reopen Workshops.</p>

No late submissions can be accepted to Workshops.
