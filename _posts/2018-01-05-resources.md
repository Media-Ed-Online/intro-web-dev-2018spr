## Need a hand?
The most wonderful think about web development is its community. This field is constantly evolving, and its success heavily dependent on working together.

### 1. Issues Board
Your first stop for aid is the [GitHub Issues Board](https://github.com/Media-Ed-Online/intro-web-dev-resources-summer/issues) for this course. Instructors and students both patrol the threads here, and itâ€™s your best place to get results quickly.

Plus, participation is required, and you can hit two birds with one stone by asking here first. Click the &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Media-Ed-Online/intro-web-dev-resources-summer/issues"><i class="fa fa-github fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>&nbsp; icon from the navigation menu above at any time to check-in!


### 2. The BA Lab (McGill 127)
Missoula-based students are welcome (and encouraged) to utilize the BA Lab located on the University of Montana main campus. Staffed by graduate candidates and open to all takers of this course, the BA Lab is a one-to-one hands-on resource where you can get help, feedback, or critique before turning assignments in.

### 3. Slack
When available, you can send messages or live chat with us at the [UMMediaArts Slack Channel](http://mediaarts.slack.com/). Registration is free with your @umontana.edu e-mail address. Click the &nbsp;<a href="http://ummediaarts.slack.com/"><i class="fa fa-slack" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>&nbsp; icon from the navigation menu above at any time to check-in!

We will be using Slack for screen-sharing, meaning we can have direct interaction with your work and can help in real-time remotely. **Please schedule with us via e-mail to set up a live meeting.**


### 4. E-mail
E-mail should be your last resort, as it may take up to 48 hours for us to respond. Please see the post on your [course contacts](/posts/contacts/) for contact information.


### 5. Self-Help
Never _ever_ hesitate to be your own instructor. There are many resources and communities built precisely for self-guided learning. Here are a few:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
